# Noiser
 
An experimental synthesizer that uses React and the Web Audio API to create earth-shattering dubbed out noise.

This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) so if you install it, it can be used even when you are offline!

## Setup

Clone the project: 
```
git clone https://github.com/ianbaxter/noiser
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd noiser
```

Install dependencies:

npm install
```

Start the development server:
```
npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:3000/ to view the application.

## Deploy

I followed this [useful guide](https://medium.com/the-andela-way/how-to-deploy-your-react-application-to-github-pages-in-less-than-5-minutes-8c5f665a2d2a) to deploy to Github pages.
